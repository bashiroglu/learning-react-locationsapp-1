This is learning based project which I practise WITH MERN(React in this repo). The idea of this project was taken from Manuel Lorenz and Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's Udemy course called [React, NodeJS, Express & MongoDB - The MERN Fullstack Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-nodejs-express-mongodb-the-mern-fullstack-guide/) and followed along with videos and hopefully added some extra features.

The name of project: learning-react-locationsapp-1

Used Language concepts:

After download project files, in the project directory, you can run :
